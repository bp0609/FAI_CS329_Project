## üìÇ Code Explanation

### üî¢ Jigsaw Sudoku

- **Components**:
  - `Board`: Renders the Sudoku board and manages game logic.
  - `Square`: Represents one of the 81 squares in the board.
  - `Island`: Represents a single coloured region on the board
  - `NumBox`: Represents individual cells in a square.
- **Implementation**:

  - **Board Generation**: Boards are generated using predefined configurations in `PredefinedBoards.ts`. The `generateInitialJigsawBoard` function initializes the board, filling a percentage of cells.

    - **Solver**: The `solveJigsawSudoku` function employs a **backtracking algorithm** to solve the puzzle, ensuring all placements follow Sudoku rules.

## üß† Algorithms

### Jigsaw Sudoku Solver

- Utilizes a **backtracking algorithm**:
  1. Attempts to place numbers in empty cells.
  2. Ensures placements are valid according to Sudoku rules.
  3. Backtracks if a dead end is reached and tries another number.

### N-Queens Solver

- Also employs a **Forward Checking** & **Arc Consistency algorithm**:
  1. Places queens row by row.
  2. Ensures no two queens threaten each other.
  3. Backtracks if a dead end is reached and tries another position.
